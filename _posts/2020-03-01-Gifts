# A note on gifts

Many have asked what we would like as a wedding gift. We recently purchased a 101 year-old home which as a few... quirks. Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift you could give us. However, should you wish to honour us with a gift, a contribution to our wishing well to help us restore our geriatric home would be a wonderful gift.
