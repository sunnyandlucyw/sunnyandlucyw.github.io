# Kids

We realised we made the decision to not invite children to the wedding when our Plan A wedding was originally scheduled for a Saturday night. Our Plan B wedding falls on a Sunday and we understand this adds logistical complexity so we are happy to invite children to the wedding if you wish to bring them. We will also have a room set up with movies and activities for the little ones to be entertained after the ceremony.

If you wish to bring your children please contact Lucy immediately on 0408 489 973 to organise and let us know of any dietary requirements.
