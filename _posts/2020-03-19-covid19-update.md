# COVID-19 Update

Due to the COVID-19 situation we have made the difficult decision to reschedule our wedding to May next year. The health and well-being of our loved ones is the most important thing at this time and we don't want anyone to put themselves at risk. 

If you receive an invite this week or next, please enjoy a sneak preview into what we have planned and get excited about celebrating with us next year. 

To us, our marriage is more important than the wedding and we will still be getting married this year with our immediate family and bridal party present. 

We feel incredibly lucky to have so many loved ones to celebrate with and we look forward to enjoying your company at our wedding next year ❤️
