# COVID-19 Update

In light of the evolving situation with COVID-19, and not wanting to put anyone at unneccesary risk during this time, we have made the decision to postpone the wedding until next year. 

We are in the process of confirming the new date, however, it will definitely be in May 2021.

Stay tuned!
